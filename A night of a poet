A NIGHT OF A POET 

 

Here, I have come... 

But where are you, my friend? 

Have you abandoned me just like others? 

Forgotten me and left me to my loneliness? 

Even, you did take them from me! 

The stars, yours and mine... 

Shiny old friends from the past! 

 

If you are listening to me, I am still here! 

Please do not cry while listening to me! 

I understand you... 

It is okay for me to live this, after others. 

 

Now go and be with the others, 

I won’t see my love’s pale face on you anymore! 

You and my love, you are far above me now! 

I’m afraid I will go back to Sun and make a deal with him. 

I am afraid my dear friend, we won’t see each other again. 

 

I am going now; I won’t sing today... 

The poet, the idiot, the miserable, won’t open up his mouth again... 

I can hear your cry my friend, 

Please do not waste your tears for me! 

I am just a poet, a lunatic! 

I deserve nothing! 

Even I can not see your brightness through the sky... 

I know you are there, praying for me. 

 

This poet, this lunatic; 

Goes to his cave now. 

He has no one, nothing to do; 

Because what is the point of being able to sing if you have no one to! 

 

This miserable, he can’t return to his village now. 

Because the only person who loves him left the village now. 

His blonde love with someone else now. 

His mother, well it’s been decade since she passed. 

His life has no meaning right now.
